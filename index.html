      Little Frog on a Lilly Pad

    <p>
      Before I do <em>anything</em> I ask myself:
      "is this something <b>a little frog on a lillypad</b> would do?"
    </p>
    <p>And if the answer is "no," I'm busy that day. Can't be there.</p>
    <p>
      If I wake up and say "<em>gee</em>, I think I want to wear a 
      <b>little vest</b> today. I want to <br> <b>play the banjo by the riverbank.</b>" 
      I'm free to do that.
    </p>
    <p>That's <em>well</em> within my rights!</p>
    <p>
      But if I woke up and said, "<em>today</em> I want to be 
      <strong>unkind to the candlestick maker.</strong>"
    </p>
    <p>You're <em>fucking</em> kidding yourself if you think a little frog would do that.</p>
