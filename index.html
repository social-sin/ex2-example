    <h1>Little Frog on a Lily Pad</h1>
    <h3>@nonbinarycowboy</h3>

    <p>
      Before I do <em>anything</em>, I ask myself:
      “Is this something <b>a little frog on a lily pad</b> would do?”
    </p>

    <p>And if the answer is “no,” I’m busy that day. Can’t be there.</p>

    <p>
      If I wake up and say “<em>Gee</em>, I think I want to wear a 
      <b>little vest</b> today. I want to <br />
      <b>play the banjo by the riverbank.</b>”
      I’m free to do that.
    </p>

    <p>That’s <em>well</em> within my rights!</p>

    <p>
      But if I woke up and said, “<em>Today</em> I want to be 
      <strong>unkind to the candlestick maker.</strong>”
    </p>

    <p>
      You’re <em>freaking</em> kidding yourself if you think a little frog would do that.
